/* As of the first printing of C++ Primer, 5th Edition (July 2012),
 * the Microsoft Complier did not yet support a number of C++ 11 features.
 *
 * The code we distribute contains both normal C++ code and
 * workarounds for missing features.  We use a series of CPP variables to
 * determine whether a given features is implemented in a given release
 * of the MS compiler.  The base version we used to test the code in the book
 * is Compiler Version 17.00.50522.1 for x86.
 *
 * When new releases are available we will update this file which will
 * #define the features implmented in that release.
