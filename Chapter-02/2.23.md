No, you can't. Because it would be expensive to maintain meta data about what constitutes a valid pointer and what doesn't, and in C++ you don't pay for what you don't want.

See answer [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/17202622/5340808).

However, a *smart pointer* can be used to tell if it points to a valid object.
