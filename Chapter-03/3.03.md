*Whitespace characters* include space, newline and tab.

The `string` input operator `<<` will regard all three kinds of whitespace characters as delimiter, so the string read from the operator will contain no whitespace characters.

The `getline` function will regard only the newline character as delimiter, so the string read from `getline` function will contain no newline character but may contain space or tab.
