If the operator were left associative, then the expression

    grade > 90 ? "high pass"
               : grade < 60 ? "fail" : "pass";

would be evaluated as:

    (grade > 90 ? "high pass" : grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass";

which means:

  - if the grade is greater than 90, then return "high pass", which is not empty string and evaluate to `true`, then return "fail";
  - else evaluates `grade < 60` and takes the result as the condition for the second conditional operator, which means if the grade is less than 60, return "fail", else return "pass".
