`~'q' << 6` is the same as `(~'q') << 6`.

1. The operand of `~` operator is a "small integer"(`char` here), thus its value is first promoted to a larger integral type(`int` here).

    'q' = 01110001 promoted to
               00000000 00000000 00000000 01110001

2. After the `~` operator evaluated,

    ~'q'       11111111 11111111 11111111 10001110

3. Left shift,

    ~'q' << 6  11111111 11111111 11100011 10000000

4. The result is -7296.
