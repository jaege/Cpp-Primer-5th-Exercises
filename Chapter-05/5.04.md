(a) The loop variable `iter` did not initialized before used. It should be initialized first.

    string::iterator iter = s.begin();
    while (iter != s.end()) { /* ... */ }

(b) The loop variable `status` is used outside the scope of the `while` statement, thus it should be defined outside that scope.

    bool status;
    while (status = find(word)) { /* ... */ }
    if (!status) { /* ... */ }
