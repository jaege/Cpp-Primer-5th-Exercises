Exercise 5.9: Write a program using a series of if statements to count the number of
	vowels in text read from cin.

Exercise 5.10: There is one problem with our vowel-counting program as we’ve implemented
	it: It doesn’t count capital letters as vowels. Write a program that counts
	both lower- and uppercase letters as the appropriate vowel—that is, your program
	should count both ’a’ and ’A’ as part of aCnt, and so forth.

Exercise 5.11: Modify our vowel-counting program so that it also counts the number
	of blank spaces, tabs, and newlines read.

Exercise 5.12: Modify our vowel-counting program so that it counts the number of
	occurrences of the following two-character sequences: ff, fl, and fi.

Exercise 5.13: Each of the programs in the highlighted text on page 184 contains a
	common programming error. Identify and correct each error.
