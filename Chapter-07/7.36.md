The order of member initialization is the same with the order they appear in the class definition. Since `rem` appears first, it will be initialized first. But the value of `base` is undefined when `rem` is initialized, thus the value of `rem` is undefined. To fix the problem, we can either switch the order of definitions of `rem` and `base` or we can use the constructor parameters `i` and `j` direct initialize `rem(i % j)`.
