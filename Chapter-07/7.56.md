A `static` class member is a member that is associated with the class, rather than with individual objects of the class type. It exists outside any object of the class.

Advantages:

- Storage efficient.
- If a `static` member of a class changes, each object of the class will use the new value of that `static` member.
- A `static` data member can have incomplete type.
- A `static` member (either a data member or a member function) can be used as a default argument.

Differences between ordinary members and `static` members:

- A `static` member belongs to the class, an ordinary member belongs to objects of the class.
