The condition of a stream is equivalent to `!fail()`, which means set either `failbit` or `badbit` will terminate the loop. For example, errors list below will terminate the loop:

- System-level failure. (Set the `badbit`) Such as an unrecoverable r/w error.
- Recoverable error. (Set the `failbit`) Such as reading a character when numeric data expected.
- Reaching end-of-file. (Set both the `eofbit` and `failbit`)
