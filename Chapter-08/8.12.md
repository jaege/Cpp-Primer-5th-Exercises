Because the synthesised default constructor will be called when an object of class `PersonInfo` is created, which will default initialized its data members. Meanwhile, both `string` and `vector` have default constructors, and will be used when default initialized. Thus, we don't need in-class initializers to initialze data members in `PersonInfo`.
