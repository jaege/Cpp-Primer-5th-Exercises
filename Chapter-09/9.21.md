The member function `insert(p, t)` has the same effect on both `list` and `vector` containers, but the cost is different. Inserting an element into `list` is cheap, while inserting an element into `vector` will cause all the elements after the newly inserted element be moved. Thus every time the `while` loop body is excuted, all elements in the `vector` are moved backward, and new element is inserted in the front of the `vector`.
