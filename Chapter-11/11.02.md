A `list` may be used when we need to insert/delete at the middle frequently, such as a linked list.

A `vector` may be used when we need random-access, such as a dynamic normal array.

A `deque` may be used like a queue.

A `map` may be used like a dictionary.

A `set` may be used to check whether a value is present.
