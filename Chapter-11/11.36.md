Use program in [ex11.33](11.33.cpp) and input file [11.36.dict.in](11.36.dict.in) as an example, in which `err1` is a line that has a key, one space, and end of the line, `err2` is a line that has a key, two spaces, and end of the line. `err1` will cause an error, while `err2` will be transformed into empty string.
