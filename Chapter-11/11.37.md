The advantages of an unordered container are
- using hashing, which gives better average case performance in principle,
- having no cost of maintaining elements in order,
- finding elements at const time.

The advantages of an ordered container are
- all keys being sorted alphabetically,
- easier to use (no need to find a effective hashing).
