When we copy a `StrBlob`, the underlying smart pointer is copyed. But the vector to which the pointer pointed is not copyed, which means both `StrBlob` objects will use the same vector. This may not be what we want.

When we copy a `StrBlobPtr`, the same thing happens as copying a `StrBlob`, but this may be what we want.
