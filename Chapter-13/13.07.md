When we assign one `StrBlob` to another, the underlying smart pointer is copyed. But the vector to which the pointer pointed is not copyed, which means both `StrBlob` objects will use the same vector. This may not be what we want.

When we assign one `StrBlobPtr` to another, the same thing happens as assigning a `StrBlob`, but this may be what we want.
