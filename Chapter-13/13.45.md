An **rvalue reference** is a reference that must be bounded to an rvalue. It refers to an object's **value**. Rvalues are ephemeral.

An **lvalue reference** (regular reference) is a reference that must be bounded to an lvalue or `const` rvalue. It refers to an object's **identity**. Lvalues are pesistent.
