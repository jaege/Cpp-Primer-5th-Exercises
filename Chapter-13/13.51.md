Because the function `clone` return a rvalue. The compiler knows that the object being returned is about to be destroyed. So that when we construct a new object from the return value or assign the return value to an object, we call move constructor or move-assignment operator. Thus no copy is made. The resource is moved from the return object to the new object.
