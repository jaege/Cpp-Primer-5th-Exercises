(a) Book

No arithmetic operator should be defined for class `Book`, since no operation has logical mapping from built-in arithmetic operators. No relational operator should be defined for class `Book`, since there is not a single logical order for this class. The `Book` class does not need a copy- and move-assignment operator, because all data members can be copy- or move-assign correctly by the synthesized ones.

    class Book {
      friend bool operator==(const Book &, const Book &);
      friend bool operator!=(const Book &, const Book &);
