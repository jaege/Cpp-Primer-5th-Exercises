(a) `class Derived : public Derived { ... };` Incorrect, it is impossible to derive a class from itself.

(b) `class Derived : private Base { ... };` This is not only a declaration, but also a definition.

(c) `class Derived : public Base;` Incorrect. The declaration of a derived class contains the class name but does not include its derivation list.
