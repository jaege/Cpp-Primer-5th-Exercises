The **static type** is the type with which a variable is declared or that an expression yields. It is always known at compile time.

The **dynamic type** is the type of the object in memory that the variable or expression represents. It is not known until run time. The dynamic type of an expression that is neither a reference nor a pointer is always the same as that expression's static type.
