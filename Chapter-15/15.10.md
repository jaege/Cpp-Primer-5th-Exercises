`ifstream` is inherited from `istream`. Thus, we can use objects of type `ifstream` as if they were `istream` objects. The parameter of `read` function is a reference to base type `istream`, the automatic derived-to-base conversion applies when we pass a derived type `ifstream` to that function. Inside `read` function, we can use the `istream` subpart in the `ifstream` object through the reference.
