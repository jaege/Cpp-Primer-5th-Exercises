The `Query_base` class is an abstract class with no data member, we cannot create object of type `Query_base` directly, but we can create reference or pointer to `Query_base`. When we copy, move, assign or destroy reference or pointer, we actually copy, move, assign or destroy the underlying concrete class, what happens depends on the definitions of the underlying concrete class.
