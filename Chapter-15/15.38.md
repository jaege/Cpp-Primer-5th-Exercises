All three declarations are illegal. We cannot directly create object of `BinaryQuery`, `AndQuery` or `OrQuery`. All these class are used for implementation, and they are not part of the interface. User code cannot use them directly, because all members of these class are not `public`, including constructors. Meanwhile, there is not constructor for class `BinaryQuery`, `AndQuery` or `OrQuery` that takes a `shared_ptr<Query_base>` as parameter.
