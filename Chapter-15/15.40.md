> In the `OrQuery` `eval` function what would happen if its `rhs` member returned an empty set? What if its `lhs` member did so? What if both `rhs` and `lhs` returned empty sets?

If its `rhs` member returned an empty set, then the `insert` function would insert no element into the `ret_lines`.

If its `lhs` member returned an empty set, then the `ret_lines` would be initialized as an empty set.

If both `rhs` and `lhs` returned empty sets, then the `ret_lines` would also be an empty set.
