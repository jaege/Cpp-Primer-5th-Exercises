When we pass a key that is not in container,

- `upper_bound` and `lower_bound` will return equal iterators refer to the same position in which the key can be inserted without distupting the order. Specially, if the key has a value    that is larger than any that of other keys in the container, both of `upper_bound` and `lower_bound` will return `c.end()`.
- `equal_range` will return `make_pair(iterator1, iterator2)`, in which `iterator1 == iterator2`. Both of them refer to the position in which the key can be inserted without distupting the order. Specially, if the key has a value that is larger than any that of other keys in the container, both of `iterator1` and `iterator2` will return `c.end()`.
