The call is correct. In the function `process`, the parameter `ptr` is a copy of the original `shared pointer `p`, which increases the reference count. Before the function scope ends, `ptr` is destoryed and the reference count decreased back to the original value. Thus, after the function `process` is executed, the reference count does not change.
